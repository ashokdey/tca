# Assignment

What I understood anout the problem is making API calls together to build a combined hotel object for both the ```HotelDetails``` and ```HotelList``` containers.

## Environment

- I have used ```Create React App``` to save time.
- I have used ```Ant Design``` for UI
- I did built a Strater Kit in 2017 which uses HMR, I used it last year but did not use it because it's not updated, you can have a look at it here: [Starter Kit](https://github.com/knaxus/react-simple-starter)

## Note on UI

- I find myself comfortable with Design Systems
- I tried to have a basic Mockup and used Ant-Design to Buid it

## File Structure

- Components: To store the reusable UI elements
- Pages: Arranged in terms of pages like listing, details pages where components are being used

## Filenames

I prefer to use ```.jsx``` for the files where I have to deal with React components. I do so for the following reasons:

- Better intellisesnse
- My IDE setup provides quick code-snippets which helps in productivity


## Why I haven't used?

### Redux

I did not find it a good idea to use redux because of it's boilerplate code. I find it easy to keep it simple for this application.

Given an option, I would like to understand and use the Context API

### Style Components

I am yet to explore it. Most of the styling and layouts were handled by **Antt Design**
