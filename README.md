First of all I enjoyed the task. I have tried my best to do it as per your expectations.

You can find the Problem statement here: [Read the Problem](ProblemStatement.md)
I encourage you to read my thought process once, that may help you understand my code better. Please find the thought process here: [Read my thought process](Thoughts.md)

## Let's get started

I wrote the solution using an environment having the following:

- Node v 12.6.2
- npm 6.14.4

## Running the app

Assuming you have the above enviroment, do the following:

- Add the following in the .env file
```

REACT_APP_HOTEL_LIST_API=http://www.mocky.io/v2/5a7f24f02e00005200b56875
REACT_APP_PRICE_LIST_API=http://www.mocky.io/v2/5a7f23442e00005000b56873
REACT_APP_EXTRA_LIST_API=http://www.mocky.io/v2/5a7f265b2e00005d00b56877

```
- Open terminal
- npm install
- npm start
- navigate to ```http://localhost:3000``` if the app fail to open automatically, which has rare chances
