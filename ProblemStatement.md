Here's your assignment:

1. Create a generic hotel list page using this API: http://www.mocky.io/v2/5a7f23442e00005000b56873

2. Show only the cheapest price for each hotel on the list page using this API: http://www.mocky.io/v2/5a7f24f02e00005200b56875 (null prices means sold out)

3. On clicking a hotel, display a hotel detail page with details from this API: http://www.mocky.io/v2/5a7f265b2e00005d00b56877 along with the respective room prices using the above price API

This may seem simple at face value, but I would like you to pay attention to the below-mentioned points carefully.

What we will be looking at:
1. Repo setup and folder structure
2. Identification of components that should carry state vs components that are only concerned with display (smart vs dumb components)
3. Proper use of lifecycle methods to fetch data, push into the state, etc (feel free to use React hooks)
4. State management is left completely up to you
5. Styling best practices and principles. (You may copy the design from the Treebo Website or use any of your own. Only create the hotel listing and detail pages)

Bonus points if you use GraphQL!
